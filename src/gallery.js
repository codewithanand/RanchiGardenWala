Some species formerly placed in this genus are cultivated for their highly variegated leaves."

                                The major difference between Rama and Shyama Tulsi is the leaves of the plants. The leaves of Shyama Tulsi are purplish in colour, the same as the skin colour of Lord Krishna and the leaves of Rama Tulsi are green in colour and the plant derives its name from Lord Rama.
